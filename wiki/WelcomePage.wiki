= Why is it useful ? =

Python is probably one of the best languages for rapid prototyping and it is widely used both in the industry and academia. Python also enjoys a vast selection of third party libraries that expose a substantial array of functionality that ranges from numerical computing (NumPy) to computer vision (OpenCV) and of course games (PyGame). Combining Python with the exciting new possibilities offered by OpenNI and new compliant hardware like Microsoft Kinect can open up new avenues for creative experimentation.
